# Campsite Proximity Checker

For the Community Ambassador who wants to check if their My Maps are correct.

## How It Works

1. Make sure your existing POI's have the word "existing" + "gym", "powerspot" or "pokestop". And Suggested POI's layers have the keyword "gym", "powerspot" or "pokestop". Having a space or - does not matter.

2. Export My Maps layer as a .kmz. Leave the option default on the popup.

3. Select your KMZ file and set the distance threshold in meters. By default it will be set to 30 meters.

4. Click Analyze proximity.
